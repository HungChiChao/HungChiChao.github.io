Welcome to my website.

## Stars

I’m an amateur astronomer passionate about exploring the night sky. My interests include stargazing, visual astronomy, and also the origins of constellations and star charts. I enjoy finding Deep Sky Objects using binoculars or a Dobsonian telescope.

Here are some of my works:

## Photography

I'm a beginner in photography. I primarily use a CANON 5D Mark II to capture moments and landscapes. Here’s a glimpse of my work:
